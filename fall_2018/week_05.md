## Last Week's Accomplishments

Update Docker config and verified everything works!

## This Week's Plan

Get pull request merged, look into restructuring project with scripts, perhaps move scripts to dedicated folder called "scripts".

## Anything Blocking?

GitHub was down over the weekend, caused quite a headache. Not able to commit for a while, commits not showing up, pull request almost posted without all commits present. :(
