## Last Week's Accomplishments

Mostly small refactor work, editing Dockerfile to account for large changes in the project

## This Week's Plan

Continue to work on refactor, perhaps look into hosting Docker images based off of url.

## Anything Blocking?

Semester ending -> exams, as well as winding down project functions for the semester.
