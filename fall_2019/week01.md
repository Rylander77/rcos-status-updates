# RCOS Status Update

## Week 01

## Rylan Gupta


## Last Week's Accomplishments

First Weekly Status Update for RCOS Fall 2019! Met my team, and begun to 
introduce everyone to the OpenCircuits + OpenCircuits EE project and codebase.
Begun planning with Leon Montealegre (OpenCircuits Project Manager) for the 
goals for both projects. So far, we are merging the EE codebase into the 
main OpenCircuits codebase before we are to code anything. Additionally,
much of the initial work for the team this semester will be researching 
different circuit analysis / SPICE algorithms.


## This Week's Plan

Help out those figuring out how the project works, including core OpenCircuits
folk. Start to find resources on different approaches to analog circuit 
analysis.


## Anything Blocking?

As stated, much of the initial work for the EE team this semester will be 
researching different methods for tackling analog circuit analysis. 
So far we are leaning towards a SPICE type of implementation. Other than 
that, merging the EE codebase into the main codebase is holding us back 
from implementing some basic unit tests.
