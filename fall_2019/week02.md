# RCOS Status Update

## Week 02

## Rylan Gupta


## Last Week's Accomplishments

Helped newcomers with completing their first issues and submitting their first pull requests!

Found the following resources to assist in designing SPICE programs:

[Semiconductor Modelling in SPICE - Paul D. Mitcheson from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/7292571.PDF)

[Rashid, Muhammad H., and Hasan M. Rashid. SPICE for Power Electronics and Electric Power. CRC Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006.](http://s1.nonlinear.ir/epublish/book/SPICE_for_Power_Electronics_and_Electric_Power_B001D4QDNK.pdf)

[Tuinenga, Paul W. SPICE: a Guide to Circuit Simulation and Analysis Using PSpice. Prentice Hall, 1995.](https://books.google.com/books/about/SPICE.html?id=6-UeAQAAIAAJ)

Additionally, the following open source repositories could be useful in achieving our desired behaviour for EE.

https://github.com/imr/ngspice

https://github.com/Aerlinger/maxwell

https://github.com/willymcallister/circuit-sandbox/blob/master/js/schematic.js


## This Week's Plan

Research these different repos to see what we can use / draw inspiration from / incorporate into our project.


## Anything Blocking?

Still awaiting the EE merge before working on unit tests. Once this is done, the team will also be able to make solid contributions to the project while researching on functionality.
