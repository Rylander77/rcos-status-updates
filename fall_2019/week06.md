## Last Week's Accomplishments

Working on our presentation for this coming Tuesday. The team is planning out an overall design for underlaying NGspice into the project, and presenting this design during our presentation. Additionally, the team is putting in their individual contributions to the presentation. The presentation will consist of the research conducted this semester on different libraries we have found and considered for implementation into the project.


## This Week's Plan

Continue to flesh out the design for NGSpice implementation. Additionally, assist team members in contributing to new issues in different parts of the project. We will be laying out a plan for the future of the project moving forward so that next semester's EE team will have targets to hit.
