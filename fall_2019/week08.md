# RCOS Status Update

## Week 08

## Rylan Gupta


## Last Week's Accomplishments

Consolidating and finalizing our write up for the year. It is located in the wiki part of the project. The wiki page will include our research and our plans for the project moving forward from our research. Additionally, assisting members with finishing up their work for this semester.


## This Week's Plan

Whatever final edits need to be done to the wiki page before the end of the semester!


## Anything Blocking?

Given many members are participating for no credit and have prioritized their other courses, it has been a bit of a challenge getting everyone's work together and wrapped up.
