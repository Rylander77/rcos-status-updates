# RCOS Status Update

## Week 07

## Rylan Gupta


## Last Week's Accomplishments

All presentations went smoothly! 


## This Week's Plan

Now that much of our work this semester is finalized, we will begin consolidating whatever research is left and contributing it to the project. This can even include things such as goals / projects in GitHub, depending on viability for next semester.


## Anything Blocking?

This week has been all presentations, and the next week is the holiday break, so work will have to pick up after that so we can wrap up for the semester.
