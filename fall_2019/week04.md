# RCOS Status Update

## Week 04

## Rylan Gupta


## Last Week's Accomplishments

Narrowing down our options for analysis and libraries to use for analog circuits. Additionally, ramping up both OpenCircuits and OpenCircuits EE teams to be making regular commits and tackling full issues. 

With the EE branch now merged, the EE team is also tasked with restoring EE functionality to the repo. The team will also have to spend more time with git and the project itself, as much of the work done by some members has been on research than on any code contributions. 


## This Week's Plan

Hopefully we are able to decide on a library / implementation to use and begin going through it. The team has been tasked with writing small proposals on how we could use different implementations that team members have been researching. Additionally, ensure that all team members are able to set up the latest versions of the project and ensure they are able to make some commits!!


## Anything Blocking?

Since the EE Merge was a bit of a block on our workflow, we will need to do some work in crash coursing through git and the project with whatever gaps of knowledge and basic skills need to be filled in there.
