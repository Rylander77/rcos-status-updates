# RCOS Status Update

## Week 03

## Rylan Gupta


## Last Week's Accomplishments

Getting new members with their first pull requests merged!

The EE Merge into OpenCircuits is close to completion, so soon the team will be able to create unit tests and tackle bugs.

Currently, the team is tasked with restoring a couple of features from the old EE project before implementing new features.

Additionally, the Docker configurations are now working properly, both compiling in the build process and ip addressing now work with the newest PR's merged in.


## This Week's Plan

Continue to research different options for analysis / SPICE implementation, restore old EE features, and assist new members!


## Anything Blocking?

Still awaiting the EE merge before working on unit tests. Additionally, deciding on a solution will be an ongoing discussion for the team as we discover what implementations / analysis approaches we choose to use moving forward.
