# RCOS Status Update

## Week 05

## Rylan Gupta


## Last Week's Accomplishments

We've started planning out how to use NGSpice as our circuit analysis library for EE. We are planning to use some C wrapper with Node.js or WebAssembly to call the C code in NGSpice to run different forms of analysis. Additionally, I am continuing to assist those who require more guidance and assistance in contributing to issues for the codebase.


## This Week's Plan

We are beginning to draft up some more robust plans to adapt the NGSpice library for our project, as well as create our presentation for next week, as this will also allow us to further discuss our other findings and research throughout the semester.


## Anything Blocking?

Continuing in supplying crash coursing to fill whatever gaps of knowledge and basic skills need to be filled in for those coding their first issues. Additionally, compiling our research will take time, as it is heavy in exam season + hackathon season.
